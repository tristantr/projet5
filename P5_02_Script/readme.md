In this program, the user selects a category, chooses a product from this category and gets a healthier substitute with a better nutriscore. 
This program uses data from the public API OpenFoodFacts.

Execute the commande ``cd OpenFoodFacts/`` to get into the directory

Install the virtualenv package to create a virtual environement with the command ``pip install virtualenv``

Create the virtual environment with ``virtualenv OpenFoodFacts``

## Launch the program

## How to use 

Once on the Menu section, select the "Get a substitute" option and choose a category of the product you want to substitute. 

If you want to have a good substitute for cookies, select the "snacks" category. 
Then find your product, select it and the program will give you a better substitute with a better nutriscore. 
For each substitute, you will get the name, the brand, the description, the nutriscore, the product page in OpenFoodFacts and stores where to buy it.

If you are not convinced by the substitute, you can get an other one ! 
Juste select the "Get another substitute" option. 

You can add the substitute to your list of favorites, and have access to it whenever you want.
